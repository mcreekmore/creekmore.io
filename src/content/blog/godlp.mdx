import Link from "../../components/Link.vue";
import Code from "../../components/Code.vue";
import { createHeading } from "../../components/Heading";

export const components = {
  a: Link,
  code: Code,
  h1: createHeading("h1"),
  h2: createHeading("h2"),
  h3: createHeading("h3"),
};

I've had a fascination with GoLang ever since I heard about it. Especially after 
my first project using it, [triangular arbitrage bot](https://github.com/mcreekmore/arbiter), 
I've been looking for an excuse to use it for something else.

Something I find myself doing often on the comand line at home is using the amazing 
[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) project to download music and vods from 
YouTube and Soundcloud. yt-dlp is a flexible tool for downloading various content types 
from the web. It's amazing.. Almost too amazing...

The thing is, this project has so many flags and options that I get overwhelmed. After 
I figured out what long command gets me my media exactly as I want, I saved it to a doc 
and whenever I want to dl something else, I awkwardly copy it manually form the doc and 
paste it into my terminal.

Then I take my media file, say a song from soundcloud, and place it into a specific 
folder structure for my Plex instance to pick up correctly in PlexAmp.

Well yeah sure, but simplicity isn't the point right now! I want to build something cooler!

## Cobra

You've likely heard of [Cobra](https://cobra.dev/) as it is *the* Go CLI framework. For 
most projects, cobra is an obvious choice. 

I'll use the [cobra-cli](https://github.com/spf13/cobra-cli) to bootstrap the project with 
[viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) to manage configs later:

```bash
cobra-cli init --author "Matt Creekmore matt@creekmore.io" --viper
```

And we can get started by adding our first command:

```bash
cobra-cli add soundcloud
```

... to be continued
